        <p>Hi, I'm Yousab. Throughout the semester I played 1 Chess match a day and used Chess.com's free daily rating to get the scores from all these games. This is a list of all the games I played during the semester. The picture associated with the game is based on the accuracy score I earned from the game.</p>
